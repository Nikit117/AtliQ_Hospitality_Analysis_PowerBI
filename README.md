## Problem statement

Atliq Grands is a leading hospitality company that operates several five-star hotels across India. It has been in the industry for two decades, but it faces increasing competition and declining market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels segment. To regain its competitive edge, the managing director of Atliq Grands wants to leverage “Business and Data Intelligence” to inform strategic decisions. However, the company lacks an internal data analytics team to provide such insights.

Therefore, the revenue management team has decided to outsource the data analysis to a third-party service provider who can offer insights from their historical data.

### Task List

As a data analyst, you have been given sample data and a mock-up dashboard to complete the following task. You can access all the necessary documents from the download section.

- Calculate the metrics according to the metric list.
- Build a dashboard that matches the mock-up provided by the stakeholders.
- Generate relevant insights that go beyond the metric list/mock-up dashboard.
